## [UOW-22] LocationAdapter Network Assertion Repair — 2026-09-01

**Root cause:** Not an adapter logic bug — a test-isolation gap. `resolveApiKey()` in
`src/adapters/locationAdapter.js` falls back to `process.env.GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY` whenever
`options.apiKey` isn't explicitly passed. The 3 failing tests in `tests/locationAdapter.test.js`
assert "no API key configured → no network call," but the developer's ambient shell/`.env.local`
had `GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY` set, so the offline-gazetteer-fallback tests unintentionally routed
through the real Google Places geocoder path and tripped their `fetchImpl` mocks.

**Fix:** Added `before`/`after` hooks (`node:test`) at the top of
`tests/locationAdapter.test.js` that save, delete, and restore `process.env.GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY`
around the whole file, so "no apiKey option" deterministically means "no API key configured"
regardless of host environment. No production code in `src/adapters/locationAdapter.js` changed —
its fallback ordering (Google → OSM if enabled → offline gazetteer) was already correct.

**Files touched:** `tests/locationAdapter.test.js` (test isolation only).

**Verification:** `npm test` → 476/476 passing (was 473/476). Coverage on
`src/adapters/locationAdapter.js`: 100% line, 81.33% branch (gate: 80% line+branch) — meets the
quality gate.

## [UOW-23] Structural Codebase Audit & RECONSTRUCTED_STATE.md — 2026-09-02

**Scope:** No production code changed. Read every file in `src/` (58 files across
adapters/config/core/models/server/services/ui/utils) plus `package.json`, ran `npm test`
(476/476 passing) and `node --test --experimental-test-coverage`, and wrote
`docs/RECONSTRUCTED_STATE.md` — a ground-truth inventory of what's implemented, what's tested,
and what's stubbed/missing, superseding assumptions in `docs/REBUILD_ANALYSIS.md`.

**Key findings:**
- Every domain model, adapter, and service is fully implemented (no stubs/TODOs found anywhere
  in `src/`). The "spread/pricing policy engine" the roadmap doc listed as an MVP gap already
  exists: `SpreadService.js` + `SpreadConfigService.js` + `DispatchService.js`, all tested.
- Coverage gap (66.84% overall line, 91.27% branch) is concentrated entirely in DOM-mounting
  view functions (`App.js` 16%, `MapView.js` 10%, `SellerSubmissionView.js` 5%, etc.) — a
  consistent, intentional convention (thin DOM glue over fully-tested controllers/logic), not
  scattered incompleteness. Controllers, models, services, and adapters all meet or nearly meet
  the 80% gate.
- Confirmed real gaps vs. the roadmap: no isolated per-tenant backend (server is one shared
  Hono+ws process, two stub routes, no persistence); no QR-based phone-to-desktop session
  handoff wiring; no offline service worker/Workbox queue anywhere in `src/`; no policy
  mutation ledger/versioning/audit trail (`SpreadConfigService.saveConfig()` overwrites
  localStorage with no history); no analytics version-pinning or what-if simulation engine.
- Two standout hand-written implementations worth flagging for future work: a zero-dependency
  ISO/IEC 18004 QR encoder (`utils/qrEncoder.js`) and a spec-correct ISO 3779/NHTSA VIN
  check-digit + WMI decoder (`utils/vinScanner.js`).

**Files touched:** `docs/RECONSTRUCTED_STATE.md` (new).

**Verification:** `npm test` → 476/476 passing (unchanged, no production code modified).


## [UOW-24] Mobile QR Session Stash & Live Desktop Inbox Relay Handoff — 2026-09-02

**Summary:** Wired `qrEncoder.js` and `SessionStashService` into the Lead Inbox and Mobile
Intake views to close the QR pairing gap flagged in the architect's rebuild audit. The
underlying real-time desktop sync (`SellerSubmissionController` → `SyncAdapter` →
`LeadInboxView`) was already fully implemented from prior UOWs; this UOW added the missing
QR-pairing session lifecycle on top of it.

**Implementation:**
- `SessionStashService.js`: added `createPairingSession()` (stashes a `PENDING`/`PAIRING`
  entry), `connectPairingSession(pairingSessionId)` (flips it to `CONNECTED` and posts a
  `PAIRING_CONNECTED` broadcast message), and `subscribeToPairingConnected(...)` (filtered
  channel listener, mirroring the existing `subscribe`/`resolveBySubmissionId` pattern for the
  approval flow). Generalized `generateSessionId(prefix)` to share id generation between the
  `stash-` (submission approval) and `pair-` (QR pairing) id families.
- `LeadInboxController.js`: added `createPairingSession({ baseUrl })`, which asks
  `sessionStashService` for a pairing id and returns `{ pairingSessionId, url }` (throws if no
  `sessionStashService` is configured), and `subscribeToPairingConnected(...)` delegating
  through to the service (safe no-op without one).
- `LeadInboxView.js`: new "Pair Mobile Device" card rendering a QR code (via
  `qrEncoder.encodeQrMatrix` + `renderQrSvg`) for the pairing URL, with live status text that
  flips from "Waiting for a mobile device to scan..." to "Device connected!" on the
  `PAIRING_CONNECTED` broadcast.
- `SellerSubmissionController.js`: added `bindPairingSession(pairingSessionId)`, delegating to
  `sessionStashService.connectPairingSession` (no-op without an id or a configured service).
- `SellerSubmissionView.js`: on render, parses `?sessionId=...` from `window.location.search`
  and calls `controller.bindPairingSession(...)` once, binding the mobile session to the
  desktop-generated pairing id from the scanned QR code.

**Edge cases handled:** no `sessionStashService` configured (both controllers), missing/absent
`sessionId` query param, scanning a pairing QR whose entry has already expired/been reused
(non-`PAIRING`-type or unknown id → `connectPairingSession` returns `null`), unsubscribe
correctly stops delivery after a re-generated pairing code.

**Files touched:** `src/services/SessionStashService.js`, `src/ui/LeadInboxController.js`,
`src/ui/LeadInboxView.js`, `src/ui/SellerSubmissionController.js`,
`src/ui/SellerSubmissionView.js`, plus new unit tests in `tests/sessionStashService.test.js`,
`tests/ui.leadInboxController.test.js`, `tests/ui.sellerSubmissionController.test.js`.

**Verification:** `npm test` → 488/488 passing (476 existing + 12 new, zero regressions).
Coverage on modified services/controllers: `SessionStashService.js` 97.97%/97.37%
(line/branch), `LeadInboxController.js` 100%/97.37%, `SellerSubmissionController.js`
100%/100% — all well above the 80% gate. View files (`LeadInboxView.js`,
`SellerSubmissionView.js`) are untested at the DOM level, consistent with the project-wide
convention (no jsdom harness; all View files are thin DOM glue over tested
controllers/services, per the UOW-23 audit). Manually verified `qrEncoder` round-trips a
realistic pairing URL into a valid SVG matrix without hitting the version-10 capacity ceiling.
