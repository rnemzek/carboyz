## Rebuild state - 20260902
Here is how the true architectural gaps line up and how we can proceed with UOW-CARBOYZ-24.
Key Architectural Takeaways

### 1.	Client Engine is Complete: SpreadService, SpreadConfigService, DispatchService, VIN scanner, and spatial adapters are fully functional, verified, and tested.

### 2.	Current Sync Transport: SyncAdapter handles same-origin tab syncing via BroadcastChannel and routes messages through a central Hono + WebSocket relay process (wsRelay.js).

### 3.	Primary System Gaps:
- Multi-Tenant Server Isolation: Persistent cellular backend routing per tenant (beyond in-memory WebSocket rooms).
- Mobile QR Cross-Device Handoff: Wiring qrEncoder.js to SessionStashService so a mobile phone camera scan instantly opens and syncs session state to a desktop browser.
- Offline Support: PWA Workbox service worker (sw.js) and background sync queue.
- Policy Governance: Cryptographic audit trail, policy versioning (v1.0.0), and analytics version-pinning / counterfactual "what-if" simulations.



## UOW-24 completed - 20260902
Mobile QR Cross-Device Handoff gap closed. `SessionStashService` gained a second stash
"type" (`PAIRING`, alongside the existing `SUBMISSION` approval-flow entries) with its own
lifecycle: `createPairingSession()` → `connectPairingSession()` → `PAIRING_CONNECTED`
broadcast, mirroring the existing `createPending()`/`resolveBySubmissionId()`/`RESOLVED`
pattern rather than introducing a new mechanism. `LeadInboxController.createPairingSession()`
is the desktop-side entry point (QR payload = pairing URL with `?sessionId=<pairingSessionId>`);
`SellerSubmissionController.bindPairingSession()` is the mobile-side entry point, invoked by
`SellerSubmissionView` from the scanned URL's query param on load.

No new contracts on `SyncAdapter` or the `Submission` schema — the real-time desktop-inbox
relay (`SUBMISSION_CREATED` → `SUBMISSION_SYNCED`) was already fully wired from prior UOWs and
needed no changes; this UOW only had to add the pairing handshake in front of it. Remaining
roadmap gaps unchanged: Offline Workbox PWA (Epic 3 / UOW-CARBOYZ-25) and Policy Versioning &
Audit Ledger (Epic 2 / UOW-CARBOYZ-26).
